**DEVELOPMENT STALLED**

Guerrilla usability testing libre software for GNU/Linux systems!

Libre designers and developers ahould be able to do their own usability studies!

Based on Clutter and GStreamer, Ramidus is intended to record any X windows desktop and eventually support all these features:

  * Record your desktop **(done)**
  * Record your desktop sounds during recording
  * Record your face during recording **(done)**
  * Record your voice during recording
  * Record mouse clicks visually during recording
  * Record key presses visually during recording
  * Record way-points during recording
  * Provide a GTK UI for managing recordings - organize sessions by project
  * Provide a replacement for the GNOME3 built-in screen recorder (too basic today)
  * Previewing recordings in full or by waypoint
  * Adding way-points after recording
  * Adding text descriptions - for full videos, waypoints or key sections after recording
  * Exporting descriptions to various libre document formats
  * Adding new voice-over tracks after recording
  * Exporting videos - in full, by waypoint or by key section
  * Exporting videos in WebM format -  in real time, no waiting! **(done)**
  * Exporting videos individually or in batched groups
  * Toggling the inclusion of overlays - voice tracks, desktop audio, visualisation of clicks and key presses, and descriptions
  * _Add your feature suggestions to the issue tracker!_

**The software development  is currently stalled :(**

Your feature requests, bug reports and help with development might be useful some day.
